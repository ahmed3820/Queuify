/**
 * Algorithm to analyze and solve the D/D/1/(k-1) queue system for both cases λ > μ and λ ≤ μ,
 * as well as solving for t_i using trial and error.
 *
 * Queue System Type: D/D/1/(k-1)
 * Parameters:
 * - λ: Arrival rate = 1/λ: Inter-arrival time.
 * - μ: Service rate = 1/μ: Service time.
 * - k: Total capacity (including the customer in service).
 *
 * General Algorithm for Queue System D/D/1/(k-1)
 *
 * Step 1: Define System Parameters
 * Given:
 * λ = Arrival rate
 * μ = Service rate.
 * 
 * k = Total queue capacity
 * t_i = Time of first balk (time when queue is full)
 *
 * Case 1: λ > μ or 1/λ < 1/μ
 * This case occurs when the arrival rate exceeds the service rate. The queue will eventually saturate,
 * and new arrivals will be rejected once the queue reaches capacity.
 *
 * Step 2: Calculate the time of first balk (t_i)
 * 1. t_i = n * (1/λ), where n is a positive integer.
 *
 * Step 3: Check for queue saturation (trial and error)
 * 2. Calculate n(t) using the equation: n(t) = ⌊λ * t⌋ - ⌊μ * t - μ / λ⌋
 * 3. If n(t) >= k, the queue is saturated, and new arrivals are rejected.
 * 4. If n(t) < k, increment t and repeat.
 * 5. Once n(t) >= k, the system transitions to a steady-state alternating between k-1 and k-2 customers.
 *
 * Step 4: Compute Waiting Times (Wq(n))
 * 1. For n < λ * t_i, compute the waiting time for each customer as:
 *    Wq(n) = (1/μ - 1/λ)(n - 1)
 * 2. For n >= λ * t_i, the waiting time alternates between two values based on queue length.
 *
 * Case 2: λ ≤ μ or 1/λ ≥ 1/μ
 * This case occurs when the service rate is sufficient to keep up with the arrival rate. The queue remains stable
 * with either 1 or 0 customers.
 *
 * Step 2: Calculate the steady-state queue
 * 1. For t < 1/λ, n(t) = 0 (queue is empty).
 * 2. For 1/λ ≤ t < t_i, n(t) increases based on arrival and service rates.
 * 3. For t ≥ t_i, n(t) stabilizes at either 0 or 1 customer in the system.
 *
 * Step 3: Compute Waiting Times (Wq(n))
 * 1. For initial customers (M), compute the waiting time as:
 *    Wq(n) = (M - 1 + n) * (1/μ) - n * (1/λ)
 * 2. For n >= λ * t_i, Wq(n) = 0.
 * 3. For λ = μ, Wq(n) = (M - 1) * (1/μ) for all customers.
 *
 * Algorithm for Finding t_i Using Trial and Error
 * The key part of this system is finding the time t_i, the time of the first balk when the queue reaches capacity k.
 * This requires trial and error to find the smallest t_i that satisfies the equation.
 *
 * Step 1: Initialize t_i as a Multiple of Arrival Time
 * 1. Set t_i = n * (1/λ), where n is an integer (start with n = 1).
 * 2. Increment n until you find the smallest t_i that satisfies the equation.
 *
 * Equation to solve:
 * k = ⌊λ * t_i⌋ - ⌊μ * t_i - μ / λ⌋
 *
 * Step 2: Iteratively Solve for t_i
 * 1. Start with n = 1, calculate t_i = n * (1/λ).
 * 2. Calculate n(t) using:
 *    n(t) = ⌊λ * t_i⌋ - ⌊μ * t_i - μ / λ⌋
 * 3. If n(t) = k, check if reducing t_i by (1/λ) still satisfies the equation.
 * 4. If the reduced t_i satisfies the equation, update t_i to the smaller value.
 * 5. If not, keep increasing n until the equation holds true.
 *
 * Repeat the process to get the smallest t_i that satisfies the equation.
